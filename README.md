# Solar Panel Distribution Analysis
This repo documents the technical thinking behind the recommended points for the construction of the grid in the **[Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth)** area by solar panel distribution. ðŸ˜Ž This project mainly documents the basic source code of the main technology and the data involved in the project will not be disclosed.
 
## Steps of Analysis
This section mainly documents how to make recommendation for the construction of grid based on the distribution of custumer density in selected area. There are four main steps, including:
### Step 1: Define the targe range
